# TMU-Soccer-Robot-S2024
This repository will include all the code and relevant CAD files for Team BingusFC, competing in TMU's Soccer Robot competition Summer 2024, hosted by the Innovation Boost Zone (IBZ).

The microcontroller used was an Arduino Nano, which was connected to a 12V motor driver and an HC-05 Bluetooth transceiver. Through the transceiver, we were able to remotely control the robot through an application called , which can be downloaded and used on all Android devices. The robot's bracket was designed and cadded on Fusion360, then 3D printed using 15% infill and 2 wall layers.

Over the course of the competition, we competed in a team of 3, scored 13 goals over 3 games and got in Top 10.
